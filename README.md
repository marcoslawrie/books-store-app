## Integration and Building the Full Stack Application

To build your full stack application, the different technologies are integrated and work together in the following way:

1. **Frontend Development (TypeScript and React):**
   - TypeScript is used as the programming language for developing the frontend of your application. It provides static typing and other enhancements over JavaScript.
   - React is the JavaScript library used for building the user interface and rendering components. It follows a component-based architecture, allowing the creation of reusable UI elements.

2. **Backend Development (Java and Spring Boot):**
   - Java is used as the programming language for developing the backend of the application.
   - Spring Boot is a Java-based framework that simplifies the development of server-side applications, including RESTful APIs. It provides an opinionated approach with conventions and auto-configuration, reducing boilerplate code and making development efficient.

3. **API Communication (RESTful APIs):**
   - RESTful APIs are used to enable communication between the frontend and backend of the application. The backend exposes a set of API endpoints that the frontend can send requests to.
   - The frontend makes HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to these API endpoints to fetch data from the backend or send data for processing.

4. **Data Storage (MySQL):**
   - MySQL is used as the relational database management system (RDBMS) for the application. It provides a structured and reliable way to store and retrieve data.
   - The backend application, developed using Java and Spring Boot, interacts with the MySQL database by executing SQL queries and updates. It reads and writes data to and from the database.

5. **Integration Workflow:**
   - The frontend, developed using TypeScript and React, is responsible for presenting the user interface, interacting with users, and making requests to the backend APIs.
   - The backend, developed using Java and Spring Boot, handles these API requests, performs necessary business logic, and communicates with the MySQL database for data retrieval or modification.
   - The backend processes the requests from the frontend, executes the required operations, and sends back responses containing the requested data or relevant status information.
   - The frontend receives the responses from the backend and updates the UI accordingly, providing a dynamic and interactive user experience.



## Summary
The front-end part of the project is developed using React.

The back-end application is developed using Spring Boot.

The communication between these two is done by RESTful APIs.

The back-end application also communicates to a MySQL database
